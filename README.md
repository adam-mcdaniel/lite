## Installation

You can install lite by using Cargo, the Rust package manager. Run the following command to install lite:

```bash
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/lite
```

This will install the `lite` executable in your `$HOME/.cargo/bin` directory. Make sure that this directory is in your `$PATH` so that you can run `lite` from anywhere in your terminal!

## Usage

To open a file in lite, simply run the following command:

```bash
$ lite <filename>
```

This will open an editor instance with a buffer containing the contents of the file. You can then start editing the file using the various editing operations supported by lite.

### Keybindings

Here are some of the keybindings supported by lite:

| Keybinding | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `Ctrl-s`   | Save the current buffer to disk. |
| `Ctrl-q`   | Quit the current buffer. If it's unsaved, you'll be prompted to decide whether to save it to disk. |
| `Ctrl-c`   | Copy the selected text to the clipboard. |
| `Ctrl-x`   | Cut the selected text to the clipboard. |
| `Ctrl-v`   | Paste the text from the clipboard. |
| `Ctrl-d` | Delete the current selection, or the character to the right of the cursor if nothing is selected. |
| `Ctrl-z` | Undo the last change. |
| `Ctrl-y` | Redo the last undone change. |
| `Ctrl-f` | Find the next instance of text in the buffer. This will wrap on the last search. |
| `Ctrl-n` | Create a new, empty buffer. |
| `Ctrl-o` | Open a file in a new buffer. |
| `Ctrl-a` | Select all text in the buffer. |
| `Shift-<cursor movement>` | Move the cursor while selecting text. |
| `Alt-q` | Leave the editor. |
| `Alt-n` | Switch to the next buffer. |
| `Alt-p` | Switch to the previous buffer. |
| `Alt-<number>` | Switch to the buffer with the corresponding number. |
| `Alt-!` | Enter a shell command. The output will be opened in a new scratch buffer upon completion. |

### Scripting

Lite has a builtin scripting language that can be used to extend its functionality. The scripting language is a simple lisp-like language that can be used to setup your editor and add new commands. Here's an example of a simple script that adds a new command to the editor:

```rs
# In the "$HOME/.lite" file, add the following definition

# Add a command to duplicate the current selection
# down one line
let dup = _ -> {
  let selected = get-select ();
  let old-select-end = get-select-end ();
  let select-size = get-select-len ();
  goto (get-select-end ());
  unselect ();
  insert (add "\n" selected);
  goto old-select-end;
  move 1;
  select ();
  move select-size;
};
```

Now, we can see this command in action by running the following keybinding:

```rs
Alt-e dup () ENTER
```

| **Before** | **After** |

You can directly manipulate the editor using commands like `goto`, `move`, `insert`, `delete`, `select`, `unselect`, and `get-select`. You can also define new commands using the `let` keyword, and then run them using the `Alt-e` keybinding.
